# Development Process #

This application will be built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python using the framework Django.

Django allows the developers to integrate MVC ( Model-View-Controller ) architecture into the app for optimal performance.

The model–view–controller design defines the interactions between them.

The model is responsible for managing the data of the application. It receives user input from the controller.

The view renders the presentation of the model in a particular format.

The controller responds to the user input and performs interactions on the data model objects. The controller receives the input, optionally validates it and then passes the input to the model.

As with other software patterns, MVC expresses the "core of the solution" to a problem while allowing it to be adapted for each system.
